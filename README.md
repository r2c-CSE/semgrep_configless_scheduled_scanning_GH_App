# How to run Semgrep Scheduled scans on all repos in a given GitHub Org: Option-2 using Repository_Dispatch (Final)

# Why?

Customers want to onboard Semgrep quickly without having to go to each team one by one and ask them to add Semgrep to their repo’s workflow files.

They can do this for PR’s using [Repository rulesets](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/about-rulesets). 

We can now also accomplish scheduled full scans using the solution below

The solution below can be used in conjunction with the Repository Rulesets to get additional coverage.

# How?


We create a new repo - `appsec-repo` (for example) that is owned by the App Sec team. In this repo we create a workflow file that is triggered on `Workflow_Dispatch` and `Scheduled` trigger. We have 2 different schedules:
* daily
* weekly

```yaml
on:
  # Scan on-demand through GitHub Actions interface:
  workflow_dispatch: {}
  # Schedule the CI job (this method uses cron syntax):
  schedule:
    - cron: '20 17 * * *' # Sets Semgrep to scan every day at 17:20 UTC.
```

The workflow performs the following steps:

- Retrieve a list of all repos in a given GitHub ORG
- For each of the repos, calls a new GitHub Workflow using HTTP Request (`Repository_Dispatch`)
- The other workflow clones the repo and run the semgrep scan

## Workflow-1: Daily

Daily workflow file: https://github.com/r2c-CSE/semgrep_zero_config_scheduled_scanning/blob/main/.github/workflows/semgrep_scheduled_daily.yml

The `daily.csv` file should be as follows:

```yaml
repo_name
test-repo
DVWA
deepsemgrep
javaspringvulny
WebGoat
```

Note: first line must be `repo_name`

## Workflow-2: Weekly

Weekly workflow file: https://github.com/r2c-CSE/semgrep_configless_scheduled_scanning_GH_App/blob/main/.github/workflows/semgrep_scheduled_weekly.yml

The `weekly.csv` file should be as follows:

```yaml
repo_name
test-repo
DVWA
deepsemgrep
javaspringvulny
WebGoat
```

Note: first line must be `repo_name`

You will need to create the following Repository Secrets:

NOTE:
- **OPTIONAL (needed only if you hit issues using `GITHUB_APP`):** `PAT_READ_ONLY_CUSTOMER_REPO: ${{ secrets.PAT_READ_ONLY_CUSTOMER_REPO }}`- Generate PAT with Read-Only access to all repos in your GH ORG
    - NOTE: the scans run inside your GitHub Actions runners and no code leaves your environment (or sent to Semgrep) as part of these scheduled scans
- **OPTIONAL (needed only if you hit issues using `GITHUB_TOKEN`):** `PAT_REPOSITORY_DISPATCH_APPSEC_REPO: ${{ secrets.PAT_REPOSITORY_DISPATCH_APPSEC_REPO }}` - Generate PAT with permissions to initiate repository dispatch in AppSec repo in your AppSec GH ORG

You will need to create the following Repository Variables:

- `APPSEC_REPO_WHERE_SCANS_DONE: ${{ vars.APPSEC_REPO_WHERE_SCANS_DONE }}`- Name of the AppSec Repo where the scans will be performed
- `APPSEC_ORG_WHERE_SCANS_DONE: ${{ vars.APPSEC_ORG_WHERE_SCANS_DONE }}`- Name of the AppSec Org where the scans will be performed. This can be the same as the Org where other repos are
- `WAIT_TIME_BETWEEN_SCANS: ${{ vars.WAIT_TIME_BETWEEN_SCANS }}`- Wait time (in seconds) between triggering Semgrep Scans
- `LOGGING_LEVEL: ${{ vars.LOGGING_LEVEL }}` -  Control logging level for Scans
- `SEMGREP_DEPLOYMENT_SLUG`: Your organization's unique identifier within Semgrep.
- `COVERAGE_REPORT_DEBUG_LEVEL`: The desired level of logging detail (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING).
- `GH_APP_CLONE_REPO_APP_ID`: The App ID for the GitHub created

Semgrep Scanning using GitHub App file: https://github.com/r2c-CSE/semgrep_configless_scheduled_scanning_GH_App/blob/master/.github/workflows/semgrep_full_scan_GHAPP.yml 

## Workflow**-2**: Creating a workflow file in the scanning repo (this could be in the same GH ORG as customer repos or in a different GH ORG)


# Setup instructions

1. Create a new repo in your GitHub org - `semgrep-appsec`
2. Create a GitHub app as explained 
2. In this new repo, add the 3 workflow files above in the `.github/workflows/` folder
3. We will now to create some secrets and variables needed for the workflows to work
4. Go to `Settings` >> `Secrets and Variables` >> `Actions`
5. You will need to create the following 3 Repository Variables:
    - `APPSEC_REPO_WHERE_SCANS_DONE: ${{ vars.APPSEC_REPO_WHERE_SCANS_DONE }}`- Name of the AppSec Repo where the scans will be performed
    - `APPSEC_ORG_WHERE_SCANS_DONE: ${{ vars.APPSEC_ORG_WHERE_SCANS_DONE }}`- Name of the AppSec Org where the scans will be performed. This can be the same as the Org where other repos are
    - `WAIT_TIME_BETWEEN_SCANS: ${{ vars.WAIT_TIME_BETWEEN_SCANS }}`- Wait time (in seconds) between triggering Semgrep Scans
6. Create 2 files: `daily.csv` and `weekly.csv` in the root directory of your `semgrep-appsec`- daily.csv will have list of repos that would like to scan daily and weekly.csv will have list of repos that would like to scan weekly
7. You will need to create the following 2 Repository Secrets:
    - `SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN }}`
    - `PAT_READ_ONLY_CUSTOMER_REPO: ${{ secrets.PAT_READ_ONLY_CUSTOMER_REPO }}`- Generate PAT with Read-Only access to all repos in your GH ORG
        - **NOTE**: the scans run inside your GitHub Actions runners and no code leaves your environment (or sent to Semgrep) as part of these scheduled scans
        - https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta

    - **OPTIONAL (needed only if you hit issues using `GITHUB_TOKEN`):** `PAT_REPOSITORY_DISPATCH_APPSEC_REPO: ${{ secrets.PAT_REPOSITORY_DISPATCH_APPSEC_REPO }}` - Generate PAT with permissions to initiate repository dispatch in AppSec repo in your AppSec GH ORG:  I should clarify that in order to trigger the workflow, the request must be authenticated with a personal access token for a user that is authorized to access the AppSec repo- `semgrep-appsec`. To create an access token, [follow these steps from GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) and be sure that you have given the token access to the repo scope.

# Semgrep Coverage Report Action Workflow
This GitHub Action, named Semgrep Coverage Report, is designed to automate the process of generating a coverage report for repository scanning using Semgrep. It facilitates both on-demand and scheduled scans of codebases for security vulnerabilities and coding best practices.

## Features

- **On-Demand Scans**: Trigger scans manually through the GitHub Actions interface whenever necessary.
- **Scheduled Scans**: Automatically runs scans daily at a set time (17:20 UTC) to ensure continuous code quality and security checks.
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates detailed reports on the scan results, including whether repositories are covered by daily or weekly scans, duplicates, which repos have no coverage, when the repo was added, when was the last successful semgrep scan and if the repository is empty, for all the repos in the GitHub organisation.

## Workflow Details

- **Dependencies**: Installs required Python libraries (`requests` and `pandas`) to fetch data from GitHub and Semgrep and to process it.
- **Collect list of Repositories in the GitHub Org**: Fetches a list of repositories under an organization, checks them against daily and weekly scan records, and determines their scan status on Semgrep.
- **Logging**: Employs Python's `logging` module for logging, with the debug level configurable through GitHub repository variables.
- **Artifact Creation**: Generates CSV files documenting repositories not covered in GitHub scans, their scan results from Semgrep, and uploads them as artifacts for review.

## Usage

### Setting Up Secrets and Variables

To use this action, you'll need to configure the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

- `PAT_READ_ONLY_CUSTOMER_REPO`: A GitHub Personal Access Token with read-only access to your repositories.
- `SEMGREP_API_WEB_TOKEN`: The API token for accessing [Semgrep APIs](https://semgrep.dev/api/v1/docs/#section/Introduction)
- `SEMGREP_DEPLOYMENT_SLUG`: Your organization's unique identifier within Semgrep.
- `COVERAGE_REPORT_DEBUG_LEVEL`: The desired level of logging detail (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING).

### Configuration

The action is pre-configured to run on a schedule and can also be triggered manually. Adjust the `cron` schedule in the YAML file if a different timing is preferred for the automated scans.
